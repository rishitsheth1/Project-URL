Anthon has changed his perspective. He's been working with my son on SAT prep and helping him with his AP Physics as well, and has been incredibly helpful in both. The most recent Physics test, the first with Anthon's help prepping, was his highest grade of the semester so far. I have high hopes that both his SAT results and his physics results will continue to improve with more sessions. Highly recommend."
